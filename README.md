# Cpre310
 Discrete Mathematics

# Course Overview
Theoretical Foundations of Computer Engineering. Propositional logic and methods of proof; set theory and its
applications; mathematical induction and recurrence relations; functions and relations; and counting;
trees and graphs; applications in computer engineering.

# Developing Important Thinking Skills
In addition to covering the topics as listed in the catalog description, the course will emphasize the
development of following skills:
* Specifying and analyzing a system with clarity without getting lost in minor or irrelevant
details.

We will refer to this skill as “separating the signal from noise.” It is an important skill that lies at the
heart of the critical analysis necessary to solve non-trivial problems. We will present many examples
where we will formulate problems in a mathematical language to filter out noisy details and capture
the essence of the problem.
* Experiencing the process of creative thinking and innovation.

We will refer to it as “discovering, refining, and applying patterns.” This skill is also very important to
effective problem solving and advancing the boundaries of our knowledge. Mathematics provides
many opportunities to experience this process.

# Project: Mathematical Discovery through Experimentation
You will be asked to write an exploratory program and analyze the results. This project will
demonstrate how mathematics is applied in practice.
